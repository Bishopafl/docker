The following networking tutorial was done to understand the ins and outs of creating a customized network within docker.

Created a detached webserver and curling into that server to verify that the networking is functioning properly. 

Created a simple network connection that points to a webserver.

Performing a CURL request into that network to verify the setup of the webserver to our newly created network.

Verifying webservers configuration after the networking has been created and link.

Verifying that the IP cannot be CURLed into since we created a custom network.

Removing our network and stopping our webserver for container cleanup.
