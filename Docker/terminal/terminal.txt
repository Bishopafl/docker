Some Docker commands that have helped me understand how to use Docker
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lists all active containers
    docker ps -a

Creates a container that uses ubuntu as a shell, is removed when exited, will run the container in detached mode (meaning you'll have to navigate to the files you want), and is named mycontainer
    docker run -it -d --rm --name mycontainer ubuntu /bin/bash

Create a container that uses local volumn mapping for the working directory, the '-w' command will also start the container within that directory (like a performing a 'cd' command to a dir)
    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/files -w /files klutchell/rar a myrar.rar myfile.txt

Runs a local apache environment from a docker container - For this one, I had to end up installing curl on my container in order for it to work
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 httpd

Create container using php 7.2 and apache to serve code
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v ${PWD}:/var/www/html php:7.2-apache
